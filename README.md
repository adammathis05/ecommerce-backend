# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create an ecommerce backend application that would allow me to create and seed a database. The application would allow me to get a list of all product categories, the products in those categories, and the associated product tags. I also want to be able to create, update, and delete new products, categories, and tags. I then wanted to be able to test my routes using Insomnia. I enjoyed this project and felt comfortable writing the models and routes. All routes work and display the associated tags. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
